Fallacy in Developing User Experience Rating Scales

Abstract
Rating scales are widely used in user experience (UX) research to compare
and rank design alternatives, yet their development typically relies on psychometric procedures originally created for assessing human traits. We argue
that this practice commits the psychometric fallacy: evaluating designometric
instruments—tools intended to discriminate between designs—using person ×
item response matrices that exclude the essential third dimension of design.
Because design evaluation inherently forms a design × person × item data
structure, valid scale development requires samples of designs large enough to
assess how well items rank design alternatives. We show that collapsing the
data cube along persons yields a design × item matrix that allows psychometric tools to be applied meaningfully, whereas collapsing along designs yields
misleading psychometric results about person sensitivity rather than design
discriminability. A simulation study demonstrates that scales can appear highly
reliable psychometrically while being effectively unusable for ranking designs.
Secondary analyses of eight commonly used UX scales across large design samples
reveal unsystematic distortions in reliability estimates, item performance, and
dimensionality when instruments are evaluated under the psychometric fallacy.
We assess the impact of the psychometric fallacy for present users and designers
of future rating scales and discuss more advanced methods in designometric
modelling.

artifacts. The utility of rating scales in decision-making processes is contingent
upon critical statistical properties of the scale, such as item consistency, reliability
and factor structures.
The development of effective rating scales is a methodologically rigorous endeavor. Psychometrics, the scientific discipline concerned with the quantitative
assessment of psychological attributes to enable comparative evaluation of individual performance and functioning, has traditionally focused on cognitive
abilities such as mathematical reasoning and linguistic comprehension. Subsequently, the field expanded to encompass measurement of latent psychological
constructs, including personality dimensions (e.g., the Five-Factor Model).
Following the rapid expansion of user experience (UX) research, Bargas-Avila
and Hornbæk (2011) documented the proliferation of hundreds of novel rating
scale instruments. However, the majority of these instruments have not undergone
the rigorous psychometric validation procedures typically required for clinical
or educational assessment tools. Nevertheless, psychometric methodologies are
occasionally employed during instrument development phases, particularly for
reliability estimation and sub scale identification through factor analysis. Additionally, practitioners using designometric instruments may conduct preliminary
evaluations to ensure data quality and integrity.
The central theoretical argument in this investigation posits that design research
(aka designometric) instruments, specifically rating scales, function primarily
to establish rank orderings among design alternatives. Consequently, the development of designometric instruments necessitates evaluation across extensive
design samples to assess their ranking capabilities. This requirement results
in a three-dimensional data structure (design × person × item), which is an
extension of the two-dimensional response matrices (person × item) used in
traditional psychometric analyses.
The phenomenon of the “psychometric fallacy” occurs when designometric
rating scales are evaluated using conventional psychometric response matrices
(person × item). This approach contradicts the fundamental requirement that
design samples must be incorporated into the validation process. Numerous
purported designometric instruments have been developed under this fallacy,
potentially compromising their capacity to effectively discriminate among design
alternatives.
The practical contribution of this work demonstrates that psychometric analytic
tools remain applicable to designometric data through dimensional reduction
of the three-dimensional array into a design × item response matrix. This
transformation constitutes solely a semantic reinterpretation, whereby statistical
measures originally developed for ranking individuals are reapplied to ranking
design artifacts.
Given that psychometric analytic tools typically require two-dimensional input
matrices, and designometric data cubes can be collapsed along either dimension
to yield either designometric (design × item) or psychometric (person × item)
2

matrices, the implications of the psychometric fallacy can be systematically
investigated through comparative analyses using both matrix configurations.
This investigation establishes the designometric measurement perspective and
demonstrates the appropriate application of fundamental psychometric tools
for both the development and practical implementation of designometric scales.
The consequences of the psychometric fallacy are further examined through
secondary analysis of designometric data collected using eight widely employed
UX rating scales.
In the following section we present a short recap on psychometric principles
and workflows, after which we derive principles of proper designometric scale
development and discuss the psychometric fallacy. While we believe that the
theoretical argument can stand on its own, we next present a small simulation
study to show the mechanics, followed by an illustration of the real-world
consequences of the psychometric fallacy on empirical data, obtained from
several commonly used UX rating scales. Last, we discuss more sophisticated
methods of dealing with design evaluation data.
1.1. Principles of Psychometric Test Development
Psychometric instruments serve primarily as cost-effective predictive tools for
human performance and psychological attributes. Psychodiagnostic rating scales
function as screening instruments for conditions such as depression (Kroenke et al.,
2001), while performance assessments facilitate decision-making in personnel
selection and educational contexts (Schmidt and Hunter, 1998).
Three psychometric schools of thought provide the theoretical framework under
which multi-item instruments yield reliable individual rankings: Classical Test
Theory (CTT) focuses mainly on the aspect of error reduction through repetition,
whereas Item Response Theory (IRT) adds more rigor to item selection and
Factor Analysis (FA) provides support for multidimensional constructs.
1.1.1. Item Selection and Scale Development
Psychological assessments necessitate multiple items due to inherent measurement error across self-report scales, reaction time measures, and physiological
indicators. The central theoretical insight of CTT is that taking repeated measures improves measurement precision through error reduction, as formalized by
the Law of Large Numbers. In practice, this is achieved by using sets of items.
Multi-item scale construction begins with comprehensive domain analysis to
identify relevant psychological processes and behavioral dimensions. Following
domain specification, researchers develop extensive item pools that typically
exceed the target scale length. This initial phase employs qualitative, divergent
methodologies emphasizing content validity and theoretical coverage (Hinkin,
1998).
Subsequent item selection procedures employ quantitative criteria including
item-total correlations, factor loadings, and reliability coefficients. The iterative
3

selection process aims to optimize measurement accuracy while maintaining
domain representation. According to CTT principles, measurement errors across
multiple items cancel–provided systematic variance components demonstrate
strong intercorrelation (Cronbach, 1951).
Cronbach’s 𝛼 quantifies internal consistency by measuring inter-item agreement
within the response matrix (Cronbach, 1951). Item selection procedures compare
full-scale reliability against reliability estimates with individual items removed.
Items whose removal improves overall reliability are identified for elimination.
Similar procedures examine item-total correlations to identify poorly performing
indicators (Clark and Watson, 1995).
1.1.2. Factor Structures and Latent Variable Models
Step-wise item removal procedures prove adequate for unidimensional constructs but may produce unstable results when the measured domain is more
complex. Factor-analytic methods therefore serve to identify and separate distinct
components into psychometrically sound subscales (Fabrigar et al., 1999).
Contemporary psychometric theory distinguishes between latent variables (unobservable true scores) and indicator variables (observable but imperfect measurements). Complex instruments often incorporate multiple latent variables
representing distinct domain aspects. As an example, the Five-Factor Model
proposes that personality can be assessed through five primary traits, each
measured via multi-item subscales (McAdams, 1992). While primary factors
demonstrate relative independence by design, subscales within factors exhibit
stronger intercorrelations.
Domain analysis often suggests potential factor structures, particularly when
theoretical frameworks guide instrument development. For example, mental
workload assessment scales may derive from Multiple Resource Theory, which predicts independent processing of sensory channels, thereby supporting a separate
subscale for each channel (Wickens, 2002).
When theoretical structures exist a prior, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
provides the optimal approach for testing structural assumptions about latent
variable relationships (Brown, 2015). Hierarchical CFA models can verify independence among primary scales while confirming stronger correlations among
subscales.
Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) serves to identify novel factor structures
when robust theoretical frameworks are unavailable (Costello and Osborne
(2005)). EFA requires researchers to specify the number of factors and their
correlation structure. This is inconvenient because an unknown factor structure
implies an unknown number of factors.
Finding the number of factors is possible by successively increasing the number
of factors as long as a factor retention criterion is met. Common criteria
include the Kaiser-Guttman rule (eigenvalues > 1) and scree plot inspection,
but these have been criticized for being to lenient and subjective (Hayton et al.,
4

2004). A more accurate alternative is parallel analysis, which compares observed
eigenvalues to those obtained from data of identical size but randomized through
resampling (Lim and Jahng, 2019).
Another decision to make is factor rotation which depends on theoretical
expectations: orthogonal rotation applies when components are independent
(e.g., mathematical and verbal abilities), while oblique rotation accommodates
correlated factors typical of subscales (Fabrigar et al., 1999).
1.1.3. Response Matrix Structure and Item Response Theory
Traditional psychometric methods operate on response matrices with participants as rows and items as columns. Standard procedures include computing
reliability estimates on complete matrices, evaluating consistency improvements
following item removal, and conducting factor analyses on participant × item
data structures.
Item Response Theory (IRT) represents an alternative framework that treats
response matrices as collections of person-item encounters (Embretson and Reise,
2013). Unlike CTT, IRT models both person and item parameters simultaneously,
allowing formal specification and empirical testing of item characteristics. The
Rasch model, representing the simplest case of unidimensional and dichotomous
responses, specifies that response probability depends solely on the difference
between person ability and item difficulty (Rasch, 1960). Advanced IRT applications include differential item functioning detection to identify and prevent
measurement bias across demographic groups (Penfield and Lam, 2000).
1.1.4. Sampling Requirements in Psychometric Development
Irrespective of theoretical orientation or analytic sophistication, all psychometric instrument development activities center on establishing psychometrically
sound item sets. The substantial participant samples required throughout this
developmental process represent one of the most challenging aspects of psychometric research. These requirements stem from several converging methodological
imperatives.
To begin with, samples must sufficiently represent the population in question,
with the general rule that heterogeneous populations require larger sample sizes.
During statistical analysis, sample size must at least match the number of
free parameters in the analytic model to ensure identifiability, but in practice
this is usually not sufficient (Bollen, 1990). For example, in Confirmatory
Factor Analysis, each item contributes two free parameters (intercept and factor
loading), requiring participant-to-parameter ratios of 5:1 to 20:1 (Brown, 2015).
Contemporary simulation studies suggest 200-500 participants typically suffice
for well-specified models with strong factor loadings, while complex structures
may require 1000 or more participants (Wolf et al., 2013).
When theoretical structures are absent, Exploratory Factor Analysis can be
used to identify suitable subscales. However, these procedures are sampledependent, with solutions potentially capitalizing on chance or researchers’
5

degrees of freedom (Simmons et al., 2011). Cross-validation procedures therefore
necessitate data splitting: EFA on one subsample followed by CFA on another,
effectively doubling sample requirements (Anderson et al., 1988).
1.2. Designometrics
Psychometrics as a formal theory describes how a set of differing instruments
can produce a combined metric on which to compare the measured entities.
Formally, it should not matter much to construct a web usability rating scale
or a human skill test. Yet, there is an important difference that defines the
designometric situation: First, psychometric measures form a two-way encounter,
whereas comparative design studies has Design as an additional entity, forming
a response box. Second, in psychometrics the entity to be ranked is Person,
whereas designometric applications designs are compared. Whatever role Person
samples and parameters play in psychometric processes, must now be assigned
to the Design parameters.
1.2.1. The designometric perspective
A practical implication of the designometric perspective is that psychometric tools take flat response matrices as input and are unfit to process higherdimensional data. While “deep” designometric models can be constructed using
multi-level models (Schmettow, 2021b, 307-323), a practical solution exists to
put psychometric tools to use. By averaging over Person, a two-dimensional
response matrix can be constructed from a designometric box. This produces a
designometric response matrix (design x item), which in turn is needed to assess
the item properties with respect to ranking designs.
For a reliable designometric scale, its items must inter-correlate strongly, which
can only happen when referred-to design features coincide. Take as an example a
hypothetical scale to measure trustworthiness of robot faces, with two sub-scales,
Realism and Likability. The impression of realism can be triggered by different
features of the face, such as skull shape, details in the eyes region and skin
texture. For a proper scale on realism, it would be required that these features
correlate, and this essentially is a property of the robot face design process. It is
a quite strong assumption that the effort a robot face designers puts into the
eyes region must be strongly correlated with the effort put into skin texture, but
by using psychometric models with designometric data, assumptions like these
can be tested.
1.2.2. Designometric scale development
Analog to psychometric scale evaluation, substantial samples of designs are
required for item selection and factor identification. This can be a huge problem,
depending on the class of designs. For e-government websites it will be easier
collecting aan adequate sample compared to human-like robots or self-driving
cars.
When a real interactive experience is subject of the measure, a measurement can
take from several minutes to hours and a complete experimental design with every
6

possible encounter becomes impractical. A way to mitigate this problem is to
use planned incomplete experimental designs. Essentially, a planned incomplete
validation study has all participants encounter only a partition of the design
sample. For example, a sample of 100 designs can be tested by letting every
participant encounter overlapping subsets. As long as all designs are covered
by at least one participant, this will result in a complete design-by-item matrix
after collapsing along participants.
A variation of planned incomplete studies is to successively build the sample
of designs. This is especially useful, when dealing with emerging classes of
designs. This happened during the development of the BUS-11 scale for chatbot
aveluation, where initially it was difficult to build a substantial sample, before
large language models broke through (Borsci and Schmettow, 2024).
1.2.3. The psychometric fallacy
Designometric scales can be developed with psychometric tools, if using design
x item matrices with sufficiently large sample of designs. In contrast, many
designometric instruments have not been validated using a large sample of
designs, but rather on a psychometric matrix. This we call the psychometric
fallacy.
A purportedly designometric instrument that has been validated on a single
or very few designs fell for the fatal psychometric fallacy. In these cases,
researchers have failed to recognize a simple truth: The capacity to discriminate
between designs can impossibly be validated on a single design. Every alleged
designometric instrument, where this has happened during the validation phase,
cannot be trusted.
If a substantial sample of designs has been collected, a correct designometric
response matrix can be created by averaging over Persons. However, the standard
terminology in psychometric tools may still mislead the researcher to believe
that producing a psychometric matrix is correct.
When a scale validation study in design research is under the psychometric
fallacy, validation metrics such as item reliability may be meaningless for the
purpose of ranking designs. Rather, the metric will refer to the capability of the
item to discriminate persons by their sensitivity to the design feature in question.
For example, a scale for comparing designs by beauty would become a scale to
rank persons by how critical they are with respect to interface aesthetics. This is
not the same and in the next section we show by simulation that the differences
between designometric and psychometric perspectives can be dramatic.
Recall that psychometric validations require large samples of participants!
When swapping roles, validation studies that included multiple, but only a few,
designs, may not be repairable. One example is the study by Ho and MacDorman
(2010) validating the Godspeed Index, a common multi-scale inventory to evaluate
robot designs. Their designometric study included 38 items and 30 participants,
but only 12 designs. While they did not specify how the designometric box
7

was collapsed, the fact that they were still able to report exploratory factor
analysis results, suggests that they used a psychometric response matrix, as the
designometric matrix would have been too small to produce stable estimates.
To be fair, the study tested validity correctly comparing designs, although with
simple ANOVA models.
As a milder form run-time psychometric fallacy appears when an existing
instrument is used in practice to take measures on a single design. The result will
inevitable look like a psychometric response matrix and, given that publication
rules often require to report test reliability, it may be tempting for the researcher
to apply a psychometric instrument validation, e.g. scale reliability. While the
run-time fallacy does not have the same impact as development-time fallacies, it
may cause confusion when a validated instrument seems to have poor reliability.
2. Simulation study
The following example demonstrates the difference by simulating a situation,
where a fictional three-item scale for Coolness is highly reliable for persons,
but seemingly has no reliability at all for discerning the tested designs. Such
a pattern can occur when the design sample bears little variance with respect
to the property in question. In the following simulation, we assume that the
Coolness scale has been tested on a sample of 20 premium law firm home pages
and 20 participants of various ages and social background.
The simulation uses zero-centered Normal distributions to draw the parameters
for 20 design, 20 participant and 4 items. Subsequently these are combined into
responses 𝑅 = 𝐷 + 𝑃 − 𝐼 with some extra noise (𝜎Part = .5). The key here
is that items and participants vary strongly in their appreciation of Coolness
(𝜎Part = 𝜎Item = .2), whereas the sample of designs varies much less in Coolness
(𝜎Design = .05).

This simple example demonstrates that psychometric reliability (person sensitivity) can be excellent (Table 1), whereas designometric reliability is poor. In
the following study we examine how severe the psychometric fallacy is in real
data sets.

3. Empirical demonstration
In order to assess the errors introduced by the psychometric fallacy, a secondary
data analysis was conducted using data from seven prior experiments, which were
originally testing hypotheses on User Experience and Human-Robot Interaction
(Table 2). These studies have in common that data was obtained in complete
designometric encounters, with substantial samples of designs.
3.1. Methods
In studies QB, JK, SP and DN (Table 2) participants saw screen shots of home
pages and responded to several user experience scales (Boom and Schmettow,
2013, Kuurstra and Schmettow (2013), Polst and Schmettow (2014), Nazareth
and Schmettow (2014)), whereas in AH, DK and PS the stimuli were robot
faces (Haeske and Schmettow, 2016, Keeris and Schmettow (2016), Slijkhuis and
Schmettow (2017)), with original research questions related to the Uncanny Valley
effect. All experiments used manipulation of presentation time to collect data
on subconscious cognitive processing. For the analysis here, presentation times
lower than 500ms were discarded. All experiments used a (mildly) incomplete
design in that participants encountered all designs and items several times, but
not in every possible combination.
DN used OpenSesame for stimulus presentation and implemented the collection
as graded responses (Mathôt et al., 2012). All other experiments used the same
PsychoPy program and collected continuous responses using a visual analog
scale (Peirce, 2008).

In total, eight rating scales were applied to four design samples. The bipolar
Eeriness scale is a primary research tool on the Uncanny Valley phenomenon and
measures negative emotional responses towards artificial faces (see Section 1.2.2).
For the purpose of rendering the Uncanny Valley effect, it has been inverted, hence
nEeriness. Factor structure and reliability were originally established under a
9

psychometric perspective (Ho and MacDorman, 2017). AH used morphing levels
between human and robot faces as stimuli, whereas the other two experiments
used a subset of Mathur and Reichling (2016), with a few new designs added in
PS.
All other scales were applied to a sample of commercial home pages collected
by Tuch et al. (2012) (a subset in DN):
• The Attractiveness scale is unipolar subscale of the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) inventory and has undergone basic psychometric evaluation in six studies with a single design each (Theo et al., 2008).
• The two 7-item bipolar scales Hedonic Quality - Identity (HQI) and Hedonic
Quality - Stimulation (HQS) are from the AttrakDiff2 inventory, which
underwent primary psychometric validation on three designs (Hassenzahl
et al., 2003). The scales Hedonism and Usability in DN were taken from
the short version of AttrakDiff2, but will be considered separately in this
analysis.
• DN composed the Beauty scale from one item used in Hassenzahl and Monk
(2010) and three items representing classic aesthetics from Tractinsky et al.
(2006).
• The Credibility scale was originally designed to compare people’s attitude towards media (newspapers, TV, radio). The validation study used
exploratory factor analysis for psychometric item selection with 1468 participants (McGrath and Gaziano, 1986).
Participants were sampled by convenience with sizes between 25 and 45 and
a strong over-representation of university-level Social Sciences students and
associated circles.
Goal of the analysis was to examine how the psychometric fallacy compromises
the evaluation of rating scales. For this purpose, each of the data sets was
collapsed into a psychometric and a designometric response matrix. Subsequently, three basic psychometric techniques were applied to both perspectives
and compared. Scale reliability was computed using Cronbach’s alpha. Item
consistency was studied by inspecting corrected item-total correlations (William
Revelle, 2025).
The number of factors (dimensionality) was identified using parallel analysis
with psych::fa.parallel. This produces an eigenvalue obtained on real data
and compares it to eigenvalues obtained from simulated. The number of factors
is determined as the point before the real eigenvalue drops below the simulated
level.
3.2. Results
In the following scale, item reliability and factor structures of eight rating
scales are compared by collapsing the item response box along the design and
the participant dimension.

Perspective
Figure 1: Cronbach alpha item-level reliability estimates compared by perspective and scale

Overall scale reliabilities cover a broad range from excellent to unusable Figure 1. All scales perform better under the designometric perspective, albeit, the
difference ranges from barely noticable (HQS, HQI) to very strong (Hedonism,
Usability, Beauty and Attractiveness). The most dramatic difference can be seen
in Hedonism and Beauty, which both have excellent designometric reliability,
but poor reliability from a psychometric perspective.
3.2.2. Item consistency
Figure 2 shows corrected item-total correlations reflecting item consistency.
Beauty and Hedonism stand out, because all items show higher designometric
item reliability. To some extent this also seems to hold for Usability and Eeriness.
For Credibility, HQ-I, HQ-S and Attractiveness some items perform poorer under
the psychometric perspective, whereas others improve, with one extreme cases:
Item Att6 is already on a very low level on designometric performance and
is showing even a negatively correlation under the psychometric perspective.
Items HQI5 and HQI6 show poor designometric performance, but are among
the overall best performing psychometric items.
3.2.3. Number of factors
Given a response matrix, the number of factors were estimated using parallel
analysis. Ideally, this procedure returns exactly as many factors as there are
separate scales in every data set.

The Eeriness scale is part of a larger Godspeed Index inventory and is supposed
to represent a single latent variable. However, Ho and MacDorman (2017) found
that the scale decomposes into two slightly different aspects, summarized as
“eerie” and “spine-tingling”. This was established using principal component
analysis, whereas a dedicated identification of the number of factors has not
been reported. Since this was tested with only 12 designs, most likely it was
under psychometric perspective. The results in Figure 3a show that for both
perspectives the eigenvalue drops below the simulated eigenvalue with two factors
under both perspectives.
On theoretical grounds, the AttrakDiff2 inventory splits hedonistic quality
into two components, Identity and Stimulation, while the credibility scale is
a completely separate construct. We would expect three factors to emerge.
Figure 3b shows that the two perspectives deviate in opposite directions: for the
psychometric perspective, the eigenvalues drop below their simulated counterparts at two factors, whereas for the designometric perspective stays above this
line with five factors.
Finally, in study DN three independent scales, Hedonism, Usability and Beauty,
were used und we expect three factors. In contrast, the eigenvalues drop below
even the simulated eigenvalues with two factors, suggesting that the same latent
variable is captured by all three scales under both perspectives (Figure 3c).
4. Discussion
Rating scales in Human Factors research are commonly used to discriminate
between poor and good design options, rank designs, choose designs, or perform
UX regression tests in continuous design cycles. Our logical argument is that the
capability of a scale to rank designs can only be seen on multiple designs, hence
using design-by-item response matrices. We called it the psychometric fallacy to
use person-by-item response matrices in place. A simulation showed, that the
worst case can happen under the psychometric fallacy: excellent reliability is
reported, when it actually is poor.
With empirical data from five experiments we showed that the psychometric
fallacy has real-world implicitations and produces wrong interpretations across
the board, sometimes dramatic. In many cases, scale reliability is very different
between the two perspectives, with designometric reliability being generally
higher. While the differences in reliability were large across scales, on designometric level they were all in a useful range, ranging from just useful (Credibility)
to excellent (Hedonism, Beauty). But, many differences exist on item level,
going in both directions. Accordingly, the factor numbers differ from theoretical
expectations in all but one cases (Eeriness).
In the following we discuss the details and implications of our findings for scale
developers and users, before we outline an agenda for more advanced (deep)
designometric methods.

4.1. Implications for scale development
In design research the target of all research is quickly changing and expanding.
A certain swiftness and pragmatism is required to keep up with the pace.
Development of new scales is a common task, and often it is carried out by
researchers with a basic understanding of psychometric principles, such as (item)
reliability and exploratory factor analysis.
Basic psychometric tools produce vastly different results under the psychometric
fallacy. While our study used mature scales, which had already undergone item
selection and perhaps factor analysis, we can interpolate the consequences for
future scale development.
The most severe consequence is that a scale may be developed that is not
capable of ranking designs. According to an often cited rule-of-thumb, scale
reliability should be at least .7. Three scales in our study, Attractiveness,
Credibility and HQ-Stimulation did not meet this criterion, even under the
designometric perspective.
The HQ-Identity scale (and to some extent also Credibility) shows a concerning
pattern, where some items perform well psychometrically, but are designometrically extremely weak. This shows that developing a designometric scale under
psychometric perspective can lead to falsely favored items that are well-behaved
in ranking persons, but are inefficient for designs. To make the case, scale reliability when removing item HQI5 improves to 0.73 compared to 0.69. By further
removing HQI1, reliability is 0.68. While this is not strictly an increase in reliability, the same level is effectively reached with fewer items - the psychometric
fallacy can lead to inefficient scales.
While we cannot show that directly, it is likely that fallacy also leads to falsely
rejected items that are actually well-behaved in ranking designs. Creating an
item pool is by itself a time-consuming process, and the psychometric fallacy
can make it even more difficult by rejecting good items and selecting inefficient
ones. A recent example is the development of the BUS-11 scale, where face
validity demands (and factor analysis has confirmed) that Privacy is a separate
construct, but only one item was left after item selection under psychometric
perspective (Borsci et al., 2022).
4.2. Implications for users
For practitioners, the good news is that if they were under the run-time
psychometric fallacy by routinely reporting scale reliability, they were probably
better than they said. And when they continue to use these scales in the future,
the improved precision will allow them to reduce sample sizes.
But, practitioners may not yet have the most efficient rating scales. Even if
a false favored item is not directly harming reliability, it can make the scale
inefficient. In practice, UX scales are often deployed during use, for example
in usability tests. Shorter scales can be applied in quicker succession, for
example once per task, or everyday in a longitudinal study. It is therefore not
15

uncommon for practitioners to create a reduced scale, for example, when many
latent variables are involved. For some scales (Hedonism, Beauty) it is safe to
just pick three items at random. Other scales are quite mixed bags, with the
highest ranked item under psychometric perspective being the lowest ranked
designometrically.
4.3. Applications
Emerging technologies are often characterized by an innovation phase, where
multiple design paths are explored in a rush to the market. Several domains of
human-technology interaction are currently gaining momentum: large language
model technology is, as of writing, receiving much attention for intelligent agent
design. Humanoid and animalistic robot design is coming out of its niche, and
virtual reality applications are on the verge to mainstream. These three domains
have in common that, compared to classic computer applications, they are
tapping into new territories of the users mind, the social mind and the sensation
of physical reality.
When Social Experience (SX) or Virtual Experience (VX) become the new
UX, it may start with the same abundance of new instruments trying to map
the uncharted design space. This space is huge and effective designometric
instruments are needed to guide critical design decisions in hyper-excited times
(Gartner, 2023). Our results show, that the psychometric fallacy is harmful
during scale development, leading to inefficient item sets and factor structures.
It must not be purported.
4.4. Towards Deep Designometrics
By comparing the two perspectives, we illustrated that designometrics can
be accomplished with standard psychometric tools by flattening the response
box across participants. In principle, averaging across users is legit, except in
situations where users did not evaluate the same set of designs. But even when
all users were evaluating the same set of designs, this averaging across users
results in information loss. More specifically we lose information about the users,
which would be interesting in its own right. As an extreme case, it is possible to
evaluate a designometric model on the basis of a response matrix collected from
a single user. Formally, this would be a valid designometric measure, reflecting
a single person’s ranking of designs.
Designometric scales are commonly used to measure a populations reaction to
a design, which implies that on some level the psychometric matrix is useful, for
example to study the distribution of user sensitivity to a feature. Imaginable
cases exist where one could use a designometric scale for psychometric purposes.
For example, an instrument to measure trustworthiness of designs could be
used to estimate faithfulness of participants in a study (or a training) on cyber
security.
By flattening the designometric box one way, then the other, we still loose
information that is needed to secure that items are truly well-behaved. In
16

educational psychometrics differential item functioning is the idea that items
must be fair and function the same for every tested person. This is a desirable
property for a designometric scale, but a statistical model for verification would
need individual parameters for participants, designs and items, simultaneously.
Schmettow (2021a) proposed multi-level models for capturing designometric
situations in their full dimension, which could be well-suited for run-time use or
basic scale development.
On a broader scale the multi-level approach is well in line with the established
field of generalizability theory (Brennan, 2001). In that approach, the variance
in responses is partitioned into multiple sources. Thus, suppose we have a data
collection design where multiple users judge several designs, on multiple items,
the variance in responses can be partitioned into variance due to individual
differences in users, differences in designs, and differences in items. This can be
done for the response box, but can straightforwardly be extended to hyperboxes.
The designometric encounter may not be end of story. For example, for comparing
multi-purpose designs a researcher may want to add tasks as fourth population
of interest (Schmettow and Havinga, 2013).
Such variance decomposition can be implemented in multi-level models, where
the estimated variances can be used to compute reliability, whether it relates to
measuring differences in users or differences in designs, while controlling for all
other relevant sources of variation. By extending the modelling to multi-level
IRT models (Fox and Glas, 2001, van den Berg et al. (2007)) the discrete nature
of the item response data can be taken into account.
Multi-dimensional exploratory methods have been well developed in chemometrics and sensory science (Tucker, 1966, Harshman (1970)), but have seen
little integration into mainstream psychometric or UX-scale validation workflows.
Bridging this gap—by extending factor-analytic methods to multi-dimensional
designometric data—constitutes a critical next step in establishing a rigorous
quantitative foundation for multi-factor measurements.
Finally, the Eeriness scale was shown to robustly perform under both perspectives, proving that universal rating scales are possible. Understanding how to
create and validate such scales is an important next step in developing a deeper
designometric methodology.
