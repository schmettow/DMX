# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book is (becoming) a collection of articles about designometric construction of research instruments.

To start with a hard-to-deny statement:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

The discovery of designometrics started with the review of a paper, which constructed a set of rating scales for comparing school chairs by ergonomics criteria. The authors followed the psychometric workflow neatly and collected data from a substantial sample of participants. There was only one catch: They all sat on one and same chair! When the purpose of the instrument is to rank a set of chairs, there is no way this capacity can be evaluated using only one chair.
