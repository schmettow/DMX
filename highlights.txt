Highlights for Review

1. Introduces the designometric perspective, distinguishing design evaluation 
  from psychometric measurement of individual differences in UX research.
2. Identifies and defines the psychometric fallacy: validating design-focused rating scales 
  using person × item response matrices that omit the design dimension.
3. Demonstrates via simulation that psychometric reliability can be high 
  even when a scale fails to discriminate between designs.
4. Provides empirical evidence from secondary analyses of eight widely used UX scales, 
  showing substantial distortions in reliability, item performance, and factor structure under the psychometric fallacy.
5. Shows how standard psychometric tools can be correctly repurposed for 
  designometric scale development using design × item response matrices, 
  and outlines implications for future UX scale development and use.
