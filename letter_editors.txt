Dear Editors,

Please consider our manuscript, 
“The Designometric Perspective and the Psychometric Fallacy in Developing User Experience Rating Scales” 
for publication in the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies.

The paper argues that many UX rating scales are validated using psychometric procedures 
that are inappropriate for their actual purpose: ranking and comparing design alternatives. 
We term this mismatch the psychometric fallacy and show that design evaluation inherently requires a design × person × item data structure. 
Using simulations and secondary analyses of eight widely used UX scales, we demonstrate that psychometric validation can produce misleading conclusions about reliability, item quality, and dimensionality. 
We further show how standard psychometric tools can be meaningfully applied within a designometric perspective by using design × item response matrices, and we outline implications for scale development and use in HCI research.

We believe this contribution addresses a foundational measurement issue of direct relevance to IJHCS readers concerned with UX evaluation, experimental methodology, and emerging interaction paradigms.

This manuscript is original, not under review elsewhere, and approved by all authors.

Sincerely,

Martin Schmettow
