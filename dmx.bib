This article reviews the major design and analytical decisions that must be made when conducting a factor analysis and notes that each of these decisions has important consequences for the obtained results. Recommendations that have been made in the methodological literature are discussed. Analyses of 3 existing empirical data sets are used to illustrate how questionable decisions in conducting factor analyses can yield problematic results. The article presents a survey of 2 prominent journals that suggests that researchers routinely conduct analyses using such questionable methods. The implications of these practices for psychological research are discussed, and the reasons for current practices are reviewed.},

Tests divisible into distinct subtests should be so divided before using the formula. The index \{Mathematical expression\}, derived from α, is shown to be an index of inter-item homogeneity. Comparison is made to the Guttman and Loevinger approaches. Parallel split coefficients are shown to be unnecessary for tests of common types. In designing tests, maximum interpretability of scores is obtained by increasing the first-factor concentration in any separately-scored subtest and avoiding substantial group-factor clusters within a subtest. Scalability is not a requisite. © 1951 Psychometric Society.},

   abstract = { This critical appraisal aims to position the five‐factor model within the multifaceted field of personality psychology by highlighting six important limitations of the model. These are the model's ( a ) inability to address core constructs of personality functioning beyond the level of traits; ( b ) limitations with respect to the prediction of specific behavior and the adequate description of personsl' lives; ( c ) failure to provide compelling causal explanations for human behavior and experience; ( d ) disregard of the contextual and conditional nature of human experience; ( e ) failure to offer an attractive program for studying personality organization and integration; and ( f ) reliance on simple, noncontingent, and implicitly comparative statements about persons. The five‐factor model is essentially a “psychology of the stranger,” providing information about persons that one would need to know when one knows nothing else about them. It is argued that because of inherent limitations, the Big Five may be viewed as one important model in personality studies but not the integrative model of personality. },

The current study discussed theoretical issues on the use of eigenvalues for dimensionality assessment and reviewed the development of PA and its recent variants proposed to address the issues. The performances of 13 different PAs including PA with minimum rank factor analysis, revised PA, and comparison data method were investigated through a Monte Carlo simulation under a wide range of factor structures that produce small factor-representing and nonrepresenting eigenvalues for different types of measurement scales. Results showed that the traditional PA using full correlation matrices performed best in most of the conditions, especially when population error was involved. However, the overall accuracy of PA was not satisfactory when factor-representing eigenvalues were small, that is, when factor loadings were low and factor correlations were high. From these results, we suggest that the original PA be used to determine the number of factors but the estimated number should not be taken as a fixed estimate. The number of factors within ± 1 range of the estimate can be considered as viable candidates and interpretational validity of the competing models should be consulted for the decision.},

Recent years have seen a large increase in SEMs in the behavioral science literature, but consideration of sample size requirements for applied SEMs often relies on outdated rules-of-thumb. This study used Monte Carlo data simulation techniques to evaluate sample size requirements for common applied SEMs. Across a series of simulations, we systematically varied key model properties, including number of indicators and factors, magnitude of factor loadings and path coefficients, and amount of missing data. We investigated how changes in these parameters affected sample size requirements with respect to statistical power, bias in the parameter estimates, and overall solution propriety. Results revealed a range of sample size requirements (i.e., from 30 to 460 cases), meaningful patterns of association between parameters and sample size, and highlight the limitations of commonly cited rules-of-thumb. The broad "lessons learned" for determining SEM sample size requirements are discussed. © The Author(s) 2013.},

The BUS-11 was developed mainly from a psychometric perspective, focusing on ranking people by their responses and also by comparing designs’ properties (designometric). In this article, 3186 observations (BUS-11) on 44 chatbots are used to re-evaluate the inventory looking at its factorial structure, and reliability from the psychometric and designometric perspectives. We were able to identify a simpler factor structure of the scale, as previously thought. With the new structure, the psychometric and the designometric perspectives coincide, with good to excellent reliability. Moreover, we provided standardized scores to interpret the outcomes of the scale. We conclude that BUS-11 is a reliable and universal scale, meaning that it can be used to rank people and designs, whatever the purpose of the research.},

   abstract = {© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Using a hypothetical graph, Masahiro Mori proposed in 1970 the relation between the human likeness of robots and other anthropomorphic characters and an observer’s affective or emotional appraisal of them. The relation is positive apart from a U-shaped region known as the uncanny valley. To measure the relation, we previously developed and validated indices for the perceptual-cognitive dimension humanness and three affective dimensions: interpersonal warmth, attractiveness, and eeriness. Nevertheless, the design of these indices was not informed by how the untrained observer perceives anthropomorphic characters categorically. As a result, scatter plots of humanness vs. eeriness show the stimuli cluster tightly into categories widely separated from each other. The present study applies a card sorting task, laddering interview, and adjective evaluation (N= 30) to revise the humanness, attractiveness, and eeriness indices and validate them via a representative survey (N= 1311). The revised eeriness index maintains its orthogonality to humanness (r=. 04 , p=. 285), but the stimuli show much greater spread, reflecting the breadth of their range in human likeness and eeriness. The revised indices enable empirical relations among characters to be plotted similarly to Mori’s graph of the uncanny valley. Accurate measurement with these indices can be used to enhance the design of androids and 3D computer animated characters.},

Mori (1970) argued that at some point, as a robot resembles a human too much and its non-human features become more salient, the emotional response to these becomes negative instead. This negative dip is referred to as the ?Uncanny Valley?.
Which cognitive mechanisms underlie the UV is still uncertain. There is an on-going debate on whether the cause lies in individual differences or innate human traits. To examine the role of individual differences, the first question to ask should be whether the UV is a universal experience. Additionally, it could be examined whether the trough of the UV is at the same position for everyone. 
	The current study aims at answering these questions by replicating Mathur and Reichling?s (2016) experiment, adding multi-level modelling. Data analysis showed that every participant (n=26) experienced the UV, but variation exists in individual responses. This suggests that innate traits are at the core of the UV experience, but that individual differences may modulate sensitivity to the phenomenon. From previous literature, it is unclear which differences significantly impact this sensitivity. Future research should continue to focus on factors modulating this sensitivity.},

   abstract = {Android robots are entering human social life. However, human-robot interactions may be complicated by a hypothetical Uncanny Valley (UV) in which imperfect human-likeness provokes dislike. Previous investigations using unnaturally blended images reported inconsistent UV effects. We demonstrate an UV in subjects' explicit ratings of likability for a large, objectively chosen sample of 80 real-world robot faces and a complementary controlled set of edited faces. An "investment game" showed that the UV penetrated even more deeply to influence subjects' implicit decisions concerning robots' social trustworthiness, and that these fundamental social decisions depend on subtle cues of facial expression that are also used to judge humans. Preliminary evidence suggests category confusion may occur in the UV but does not mediate the likability effect. These findings suggest that while classic elements of human social psychology govern human-robot social interaction, robust UV effects pose a formidable android-specific problem.},

@article{Peirce2008,
   abstract = {PsychoPy is a software library written in Python, using OpenGL to generate very precise visual stimuli on standard personal computers. It is designed to allow the construction of as wide a variety of neuroscience experiments as possible, with the least effort. By writing scripts in standard Python syntax users can generate an enormous variety of visual and auditory stimuli and can interact with a wide range of external hardware (enabling its use in fMRI, EEG, MEG etc.). The structure of scripts is simple and intuitive. As a result, new experiments can be written very quickly, and trying to understand a previously written script is easy, even with minimal code comments. PsychoPy can also generate movies and image sequences to be used in demos or simulated neuroscience experiments. This paper describes the range of tools and stimuli that it provides and the environment in which experiments are conducted.},
